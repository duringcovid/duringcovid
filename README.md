Hey there stranger! If you're casually using the expression "during covid" then you are propagating a harmful assumption that "covid is over".

## What to say instead

When someone says "during covid" they usually mean "during covid restrictions" or "during covid lockdowns". So try to say just that, or maybe "during early stage pandemic". 

## The data
